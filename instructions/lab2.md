# Lab 2 : Enable Alexa on the NxP MCU kit

In this lab, you will learn how to configure the NxP microcontroller kit to connect to Alexa Voice service and AWS IoT Core. You will start to use Alexa voice commands on the kit. 

## <span style="color:orange"> You will continue to build step 1a of this architecture :</span>

## A.  Configure the NxP kit with Alexa
![alt text](../images/nxp-kit.png)

## <span style="color:orange"> You need to establish serial connection to the device : </span>

1. Please connect both the USB ports to the adapter provided, and connect the adapter to the laptop.

2. Connect to the hardware kit using the below instructions - 
    -   Mac -  [screen](./serial.md)
    -   Windows - [putty](./serial.md)
    -   Linux -  [screen / minicom](./serial.md)


2. Read the below and then run the commands to configure the kit to connect to Alexa Voice Services and AWS IoT services. 
    
    - *Client id* and *Product Id* is required for the kit to successfully authenticate to Alexa Voice service 
    - *AWS Account ID* and *Endpoint URL* is required for the kit to successfully authenticate to AWS IoT core
    - Therefater you enable [*code based linking*](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa-voice-service/code-based-linking-other-platforms.html) for registering this kit to your Amazon Developer account 
    - Reset reboots the device with the latest confiigurations 

    Please enter the commands similar to the screenshot below **One by One**

    ![alt text](../images/serial.png) 

    ```
    set_avs_client_id "copy Client id from config.json"

    set_avs_product_id "copy Alexa Product ID from config.json"

    set_aws_endpoint_url "copy IoT core URL from lab1 notes"

    set_aws_account_id copy_AWS_Account_ID_from_lab1_no_qoutes

    set_cbl_mode 1

    reset
    ```

    Please give few seconds for the device to restart , and connect back to the device using serial command again , and run the below. 

    - Enable USB logging to monitor the device interaction with AWS IoT Core and AVS
    - When you talk to Alexa, this console will print the device activity 
    
    ```
      enable_usb_log
      logs
    ```

    **If the session exits for some reason anywhere, please connect to the serial terminal again.If serial terminal is still not accessible , please power cycle the device.**

    You will get the User code and the URL from the console :

4.  Copy the user code from the logs and navigate to [amazon.code](https://amazon.com/us/code) on your browser to authenticate - 

    - Login with the same email , if prompted, that you used for the Alexa developers console prior in Lab 1
    - Paste the user code and submit. *Registration successful* should appear on the web page

6. Check back on the serial terminal - 
    - Device will periodically check for a token, may take up to 60 seconds
    - After that it will register and be ready to use.
    - The log will show if any errors.

## <span style="color:green"> Try Alexa, time in las vegas </span>

    *And get to know about the fantastic weather in vegas.*

## B.  Navigate to AWS IoT console 

Please login to the [AWS IoT Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/) and select *Manage* (on the left pane) -> Things. 

1. Check if you can see the Thing created with the serial # of your NxP kit (on the right pane). 
2. Click on *Monitor* (left pane) and check on the graphs (in the right pane) for successfull Connections.  

To learn more about AVS Integration for AWS IoT, please click [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa-voice-service/avs-for-aws-iot-overview.html).

<span style="color:orange">Please keep the board muted. Press the switch SW1 on the board , and it will mute and turn on the red led. 
</span>
