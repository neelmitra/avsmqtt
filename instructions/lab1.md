4. Click here to create [cloudformation-stack-us-east-1](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/create/review?stackName=reinventavsmqtt&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/alexa-reinvent/avs-iot-cfn.yaml)
    
    a. Enter the serial number, you copied earlier

    b. Leave rest of the options default and click Create

    <span style="color:orange">The cloudformation will take between 3-5 mins to complete. Once complete - </span>

## B. Create AVS Product  

After you've created an Amazon developer account, you'll need to create a product and security profile. This will enable your hardware kit (NxP) to connect to Alexa Voice Service.

Log in to [AVS console](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/avs/home). 

If this is your first time using AVS, you'll see a welcome screen. Click the GET STARTED button, then click the CREATE PRODUCT button.

If you're a returning developer, click the Products -> CREATE PRODUCT button at the top right corner of the screen.

## <span style="color:orange"> Fill in product information</span>

1. Product Name: MQTT for AVS 

2. Product ID: PrototypeIoT

3. Please Select Your Product Type: Device with Alexa Built-in

    Will your device use a companion app?  **No**

    ![alt text](../images/avs1.png)

4. Product Category: Other (Please specify)
    - Enter Value: Prototype

5. Brief Product description: Prototype

6. How will users interact with your product? : Hands-free

    ![alt text](../images/avs2.png)

7. **Skip** the Upload an image step. This is not required for prototyping.

8. Select the options as below and click Next to Continue.

    <span style="color:orange">Please use the AWS Account # you copied in Section A - Step 1.</span>

    ![alt text](../images/avs3.png)

9. Click **CREATE NEW PROFILE**.


10. Enter your own custom Security Profile Name and Security Profile Description for the following fields - or use the below example names:
    - Security Profile Name: **MQTT for AVS Profile**
    - Security Profile Description: AVS IoT Workshop
    - Click NEXT.

    ![alt text](../images/avs4.png)

    **Security Profile ID** will be generated for you.

11. Select **Other devices and platforms** in the **Platform Information** section.

    - Client ID name -  **Prototype**
    - Click **Generate ID** and **Download**
        -  You will need the Client Id in the next section
    - Check the box **I agree to the AVS ..** and Click **FINISH**.

    ![alt text](../images/otherdevicesplatforms2.png)

<span style="color:orange">You will get the message, Product has been created. Click Ok and move to section B.</span>
    <font color="orange">In the next lab you will need the following from this lab : </font>
    
    - AVS Client ID and Product ID available in the downloaded config.json file from Section A - Step 11

    - AWS IoT Endpoint Url from Section B - Step 4

Congratulations! You now have created the Alexa Voice Product and the AWS resources. In the next lab , you will embed these configurations on the hardware , so they can communicate with Alexa Voice service and AWS IoT services. 

### See you in [lab2](./lab2.md).
